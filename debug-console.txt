LEBANON PROPERTY TAX DATABASE - DEBUG CONSOLE LOG
=================================================

Current Issues:
- Index page dropdown button is not clickable (arrow unresponsive)
- CSS styling appears correct but functionality broken
- Likely caused by CSS !important declarations interfering with JavaScript

Expected Behavior:
- Clicking dropdown button should show/hide checkbox list
- Hierarchical checkboxes should work with parent-child relationships
- Both index.html and map.html should have identical functionality

Files Modified:
- working-checkbox-filters.js (hierarchical logic)
- working-checkbox-styles.css (CSS specificity fixes)

Console Messages to Watch For:
- "Dropdown clicked:" - indicates button click detected
- "DEBUG: Parent checked, auto-checking children for [code]"
- "DEBUG: Child unchecked, so unchecked parent [code]"
- "Selected classes: [array]"

Troubleshooting Steps:
1. Check if JavaScript click handlers are working
2. Verify CSS display properties aren't conflicting
3. Test hierarchical behavior after click functionality restored

Last Working State:
- Map page: Fully functional hierarchical dropdowns
- Index page: Styled but unclickable
