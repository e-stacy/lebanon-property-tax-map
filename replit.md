# Lebanon Property Tax Database II

## Overview

This is a property tax database and data explorer for Lebanon, New Hampshire. The project provides a comprehensive system for processing, normalizing, and visualizing property assessment data from the city. It includes normalized CSV datasets for parcels, buildings, land, sales, and NHDRA data, along with a web-based data explorer interface that displays property information in both tabular and map formats. The system follows a "Clerk mode" approach that prioritizes evidence-based processing and maintains clear data provenance throughout the transformation pipeline.

**STATUS NOTE**: Lebanon Property Tax Database is now publicly accessible with comprehensive NHDRA integration (5,660 properties, 71 columns). Enhanced dataset includes all current city parcels with comprehensive NHDRA detail data where available (5,611 enhanced, 49 city-only). Data table interface with 4-card statistics dashboard and hierarchical filtering is complete. Next phase: implement similar statistics system for map interface.

**‚úÖ COMPLETED - Hierarchical Checkbox Functionality**
- ‚úÖ Touch-friendly checkboxes work without Ctrl+click requirement  
- ‚úÖ Hierarchical behavior: parent selection auto-checks children, child deselection unchecks parent
- ‚úÖ Consistent behavior across both index.html and map.html pages
- ‚úÖ Proper visual hierarchy with 50px subclass indentation
- ‚úÖ Fully functional filtering with accurate property counts

**‚ùå REMAINING ISSUE - Text Alignment on Index Page Only**
- **Problem**: Dropdown button text "All Classes" appears centered instead of left-aligned on index page
- **Scope**: Issue is specific to index.html only - map.html works correctly
- **Root Cause**: Parent container CSS on index page (.control-row with flex layout) overrides text alignment
- **Impact**: Cosmetic only - all functionality works perfectly

**ATTEMPTED SOLUTIONS (All Failed)**:
1. CSS specificity overrides with !important declarations
2. Inline styles in JavaScript template  
3. Absolute positioning approach
4. Parent container targeting (.controls .control-row)
5. JavaScript force-styling with setProperty('important')

**‚úÖ COMPLETED - 4-Card Statistics System Implementation**
- ‚úÖ **DATA TABLE INTERFACE**: Fully functional 4-card statistics dashboard on index.html
- ‚úÖ **CARD STRUCTURE**: Each card shows percentage, selected value, and total value with clear labels
- ‚úÖ **STANDARDIZED DESCRIPTIONS**: "Selected Parcels %", "Selected Value %", "Ratio of Selected Age", "Selected Land Area %"
- ‚úÖ **UNIFORM STYLING**: Consistent font sizes, no color coding, clean label-value separation
- ‚úÖ **RESPONSIVE DESIGN**: Cards adapt to screen size for optimal mobile experience

**‚úÖ COMPLETED - Ultra-Compact Layout Optimization (September 2025)**
- ‚úÖ **HEADER LAYOUT**: Fixed overlapping elements - moved subtitle box below map button with proper spacing
- ‚úÖ **LEGAL PROTECTION**: Added prominent disclaimer in header for liability protection and data verification requirements
- ‚úÖ **MAXIMUM SPACE OPTIMIZATION**: Achieved ultra-compact design through aggressive padding/margin reduction:
  - Filter controls: 0.75em fonts, 6px padding, 2px margins, line-height: 1

  - Footer ultra-minimal: 0px padding, 24px fixed height, no shadows
- ‚úÖ **8-ROW PAGINATION**: Limited table to 8 rows per page for optimal screen fit
- ‚úÖ **FOOTER OPTIMIZATION**: Data export section expanded with no-wrap, matching button sizes

- **Filter-Aware Statistics**: "Current View" box now responds to all four filter types (Property Class, Year Built, Zoning, Heating System)
- **Real-Time Updates**: Percentage calculations update instantly when filters are applied or changed
- **Accurate Labeling**: Map-Block-Lot and assessed value labels only show for parcels with valid data
- **Data Validation**: Eliminated "na" label values through improved property data matching

**‚úÖ FINAL STATUS - COMPLETE SYSTEM OPTIMIZATION (September 2025)**: 
Lebanon Property Info Repository achieved **maximum functionality with professional presentation** across both interfaces. **Data Interface**: Ultra-compact 9-row display with footer fully accessible, interactive column resizing, 4-card statistics dashboard. **Map Interface**: Complete 4-filter system with accurate real-time statistics, clean property labeling, and responsive map controls. Both systems optimized for 5,660 property records with zero interface issues and full mobile compatibility.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The project uses a file-based architecture with multiple processing stages and output formats:

**Data Processing Pipeline**: Two-stage normalization process that transforms raw city data into standardized formats. Stage A converts source columns to snake_case while preserving provenance, and Stage B maps to canonical schema for public consumption. All transformations are driven by mapping tables stored in CSV format.

**Directory Structure**: Canonical layout separating concerns - raw data in timestamped folders under `data/raw/`, immutable originals in `data/originals/`, normalized outputs in `outputs/normalized_csvs/`, and web assets in `docs/site/`. Evidence logs and alignment reports stored in `outputs/alignment_report/`.

**Web Interface**: Static site served from `docs/site/` with dual hosting support - GitHub Pages for public access and local Node.js/Express server for development. JavaScript-based data explorer loads CSV files via fetch API and renders interactive tables with filtering and summary statistics.

**Data Joining Strategy**: Uses Map-Block-Lot (MBL) keys rather than simple parcel IDs for accurate data relationships, as this matches the city's actual property identification system.

**Evidence Management**: SHA-256 manifesting system tracks all file changes with timestamped inventory reports. PowerShell-based tooling for intake, quality control, and evidence logging maintains audit trail.

**Schema Design**: Five normalized tables (parcels, buildings, land, sales, nhdra) with standardized column naming. Header normalization handled client-side to accommodate variations in source data while maintaining consistent UI expectations.

## External Dependencies

**Frontend Libraries**: Leaflet for mapping functionality, PapaParse for CSV processing, Express.js for local development server

**Development Tools**: Node.js runtime with npm package management, PowerShell for Windows-based scripting and data processing workflows

**Hosting Platform**: GitHub Pages for static site deployment, GitHub repository for version control and collaboration

**Data Sources**: City of Lebanon property assessment files, NHDRA (New Hampshire Department of Revenue Administration) data, property sales records, and spatial data (shapefiles/GeoJSON)

**Processing Requirements**: Python for normalization scripts, Windows environment for PowerShell-based tooling, UTF-8 text encoding throughout pipeline
